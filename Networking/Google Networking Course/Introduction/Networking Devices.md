**use light signals to transfer data in thin glass tubes of width of nearly human hair.**


## Hubs and Switches
Used to connect in LAN network

### Hub (LAYER - 1 Device)

Allows multiple computer to connect.
Not Intelligent. Broadcast data to all the workstations in a network , they can identify if data is made for them or not.

**This creates Collision Domain**

Collision domain makes the system to wait if two system try sending data at the same time and asks them to re send the data.

### Switch (LAYER-2 Device)

Only sends data to the correct system.

## Routers (LAYER- 3 Device)
![[Pasted image 20210405030420.png]]
Knows how to forward data between independent networks
Inspects IP data to get the exact location to send data on network
